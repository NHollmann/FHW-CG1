# Documentation

This is the documentation for our solutions to the computer graphics (CG1) exercises at [FH Wedel](https://www.fh-wedel.de/).

## [Compilation](compilation)
Here you can find more information on how to compile the code yourself.

## [Exercise 01](ueb01/)
A Pong clone in 2D.

## [Exercise 02](ueb02/)
A 2D Labyrinth Puzzle Game.

## [Exercise 03](ueb03/)
A 3D Labyrinth Puzzle Game, building on the previous exercise.

## [Exercise 04](ueb04/)
An interactive water wave simulation with textures.

## [Exercise 05](ueb05/)
A shader exercise using vertex and fragment shaders to display a terrain. Includes Phong and Gouraud lighting models.

## Common Keybindings
Every program has an inbuilt help. Just press h to view it. 
In exercise one and 5 the help is printed in the console, in the other programs its directly displayed on screen.

Other common keybindings:

| Key | Function          |
|-----|-------------------|
| H   | Help              |
| F1  | Wireframe on/off  |
