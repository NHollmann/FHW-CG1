# FHW-CG1
Our solutions to the computer graphics exercises at [FH Wedel](https://www.fh-wedel.de/).
Created in collaboration during the summer semester 2019.

The repository contains solutions for five separate exercises:
1. A Pong clone in 2D.
2. A 2D Labyrinth Puzzle Game.
3. A 3D Labyrinth Puzzle Game, building on the previous exercise.
4. An interactive water wave simulation with textures.
5. A shader exercise using vertex and fragment shaders to display a terrain. Includes Phong and Gouraud lighting models.
